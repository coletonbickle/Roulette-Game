# Roulette-Game
As I have newly become inspired to create projects in Python, I have decided to start on a small game.
Back in one of my freshmen year prereqs. I took a CS class that was taught in C and was required for nearly all engineering disciplines.
One of the Homeworks was tasked to create Routelle game. I decided to revisit this old project and refactor it in Python.
I intend on expanding my knowledge with coding GUIs and hope to create a functional GUI Roulette Game.
